Reminder of package construction


This is in my personal account for the moment, but will eventually come to rest on DistanceDevelopment as this deals with distance sampling.

The *readme* file is being changed on the local machine, with an existing project in RStudio.

- work in progress
- do not clone or copy

### Another small change

This will assess whether we have credential issues.


> No need for that challenger line.

### Now on home computer
GitKraken being used because RStudio is not quite up to speed as yet, might require a reboot.

#### Here we are
Now on home machine, running RStudio.  Having opened .Rproj file, now presented with Git tab.  This edit of file taking place in RStudio.


## Second (third) home edit [second edit using RStudio]
Edit for purposes of seeing whether second push generates credentials challenge (or if credentials have been saved)
